# MITAppInventor Application

## Overview
This project is a reaction time test that was presented as an idea to help reduce the issue of drunk driving. Users have to take the test 3 times, and the program determines whether they are fit to drive or not. There are two apps: 
1. Drivaholic - This app is for normal users. It contains the reaction time test, and determines if the user is fit to drive
2. Drivaholic Police - This app is for the police/authorities. It displays the details of users that have failed the reaction time test in the first app.
